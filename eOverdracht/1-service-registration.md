# Service registration

## Description

This manual describes how to register the services required for performing a patient transfer using the eOverdracht Bolt.
The services are used for resolving technical endpoints and must be published by the care organization's vendor.

This manual assumes the vendor and its care organization(s) have been registered.

## Resources

- **eOverdracht Bolt**: https://nuts-foundation.gitbook.io/bolts/eoverdracht/leveranciersspecificatie

## eOverdracht Services

Bolts specify which technical endpoints (URLs, e.g. http://nuts.nl) are required for exchanging data.
Bolts generally specify these as *compound services*, which is a service on a DID document containing a set of technical endpoints.
For instance, the eOverdracht-receiver service must contain a `notification` and `oauth` endpoint.

The eOverdracht Bolt specifies 2 services; `eOverdracht-sender` and `eOverdracht-receiver`.
The sender service must be registered by organizations that want to transfer patients to other care organizations.
The receiver service must be registered by organizations that want to accept patients transfers.
Of course, an organization can (and often will) support both services.

For the vendor/care organization DID document setup, the technical endpoints and compound services are registered on the vendor's DID document.
Then, when the vendor wants to enable a Bolt for a specific customer (care organization),
it can register a service on the organization's DID document that references that specific compound service on the vendor's DID document.
Although this setup isn't required, it makes administration easier because endpoints aren't duplicated for every other customer.

### Technical endpoints

First, the technical endpoints need to be registered as services on the vendor's DID document. The eOverdracht Bolt specifies the following endpoints:

* `oauth`: for requesting access tokens to access (remote) protected resources. Required for both `eOverdracht-sender` and `eOverdracht-receiver`.
* `fhir`: for reading/updating resources at the remote care organization's FHIR server. Required for `eOverdracht-sender`.
* `notification`: for notifying a remote care organization that a patient transfer is registered/updated. Required for `eOverdracht-receiver`. 

Below you find the HTTP operations to register these endpoints. Make sure to replace `{did}` with the vendor's DID.

#### OAuth Access Token Endpoint
The access token endpoint is exposed by the Nuts node and is one of the *Node to Node* (`n2n`) endpoints.
Replace `<external-node-address>` with the host/port through which your node can be reached by external Nuts nodes.


```http request
POST http://localhost:1323/internal/didman/v1/did/{did}/endpoint
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "oauth",
  "endpoint": "<external-node-address>/n2n/auth/v1/accesstoken"
}
```

#### FHIR Endpoint
The FHIR endpoint is exposed by a FHIR server (or proxy that forwards requests to it) which additionally checks authentication/authorization.
Replace `<external-fhir-address>` with the correct host/port, so it can be reached by external EHRs.
In test/development setups *Nuts Demo EHR* could be used as proxy for the FHIR server. 

```http request
POST http://localhost:1323/internal/didman/v1/did/{did}/endpoint
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "fhir",
  "endpoint": "<external-fhir-address>/fhir"
}
```

#### Notification Endpoint
The notification endpoint is exposed by the EHR and notified when an eOverdracht sender creates a transfer for the local (receiving) care organization.
Replace `<external-ehr-address>` with the correct host/port, so it can be reached by external EHRs. This could be *Nuts Demo EHR* for test/development setups.

```http request
POST http://localhost:1323/internal/didman/v1/did/{did}/endpoint
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "notification",
  "endpoint": "<external-ehr-address>/web/external/transfer/notify"
}
```

### Registering eOverdracht Sender service

To register the `eOverdracht-sender` compound service, perform the following HTTP operation (make sure to replace `{did}` with the vendor's DID):

```http request
POST http://localhost:1323/internal/didman/v1/did/{did}/compoundservice
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "eOverdracht-sender",
  "serviceEndpoint": {
    "fhir": "{did}/serviceEndpoint?type=fhir",
    "oauth": "{did}/serviceEndpoint?type=oauth"
  }
}

```

Note that the `serviceEndpoint` field contains reference to technical endpoints we've just defined. That way technical endpoints can be re-used by multiple services/Bolts.

### Registering eOverdracht Receiver service

To register the `eOverdracht-receiver` compound service, perform the following HTTP operation (make sure to replace `{did}` with the vendor's DID):

```http request
POST http://localhost:1323/internal/didman/v1/did/{did}/compoundservice
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "eOverdracht-receiver",
  "serviceEndpoint": {
    "notification": "{did}/serviceEndpoint?type=notification",
    "oauth": "{did}/serviceEndpoint?type=oauth"
  }
}
```

Code sample for compound service registration: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-registry-admin-demo/blob/master/domain/sp/service.go#L173-L194

## Enabling Bolts for customers

Now that the technical endpoints and compound services have been registered on the vendor's DID document, the Bolt services can be enabled for its customers.
This is done by registering a service that references the specific vendor's compound service.

Perform the following HTTP operation to enable `eOverdracht-sender` for a customer. Make sure to replace `{customerDID}` with the customer's DID and `{vendorDID}` with the vendor's DID.

```http request
POST http://localhost:1323/internal/didman/v1/did/{customerDID}/endpoint
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "eOverdracht-sender",
  "endpoint": "{vendorDID}/serviceEndpoint?type=eOverdracht-sender"
}
```

Vice versa, to enable `eOverdracht-receiver` for a customer:

```http request
POST http://localhost:1323/internal/didman/v1/did/{customerDID}/endpoint
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "eOverdracht-receiver",
  "endpoint": "{vendorDID}/serviceEndpoint?type=eOverdracht-receiver"
}
```
